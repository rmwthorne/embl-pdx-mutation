## Setting up yourself

- If you want to set up on another computer, you can install Docker Community Edition (CE) following the instructions in the link above
- You can then install ORCA by running `docker pull bcgsc/orca` anywhere
- Without access to a computing cluster, Galaxy remains a great way to learn bioinformatics. We will include links to relevent tutorials to keep you going, now that you know what's happening 'under the hood'

If you have any questions or problems feel free to contact me.
